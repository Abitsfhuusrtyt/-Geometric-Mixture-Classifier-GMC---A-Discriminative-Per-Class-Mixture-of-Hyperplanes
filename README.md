# -Geometric-Mixture-Classifier-GMC---A-Discriminative-Per-Class-Mixture-of-Hyperplanes
GMC is a lightweight, plane-based probabilistic classifier. It learns a small set of linear separators to carve the feature space and outputs well-calibrated probabilities. In our tests it matches/bests strong baselines (e.g., RBF-SVM) with lower latency. Defaults: linear, 6 planes, RFF=256.
